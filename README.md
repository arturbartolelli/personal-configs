# My Personal Configs
These are my personal configs for *Zed* and *Nvim*, i'm trying to get better at them, but i think my new main editor is Zed.

I'm just curious about Nvim and it's been a journey for me. But Zed can be fast and it's easy to use.

I hope to get better at Vim Motions this year and it's one of my goals as programmer.
